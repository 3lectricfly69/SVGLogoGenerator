# SVGLogoGenerator
With a given command-line application that accepts a user's input, prompts appear for a 3-character text input. These prompts include inquiries about text, text color, and text shape. These inquiry responses then generate a logo that is in a .svg file format, which can be opened and viewed in the browser. 

 Directions to operate this command line application / generate output SVG:
 -- Open the terminal located in the root directory >> run the command "node LogoGen.js" >> enter responses according to prompted questions that appear
 -- right-click logo.svg file that is generated >> navigate to Live Server to view new SVG image output
